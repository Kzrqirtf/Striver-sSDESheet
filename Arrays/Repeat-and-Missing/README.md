<h3>Problem statement</h3>
<p>
You are given an array of size ‘N’. The elements of the array are in the range from 1 to ‘N’.

Ideally, the array should contain elements from 1 to ‘N’. But due to some miscalculations, there is a number R in the range [1, N] which appears in the array twice and another number M in the range [1, N] which is missing from the array.

Your task is to find the missing number (M) and the repeating number (R</p>

<p>For example:
Consider an array of size six. The elements of the array are { 6, 4, 3, 5, 5, 1 }. 
The array should contain elements from one to six. Here, 2 is not present and 5 is occurring twice. Thus, 2 is the missing number (M) and 5 is the repeating number (R).

Can you do this in linear time and constant additional space?

Constraints:
2 <= N <= 5 * 10^4
1 <= data <= N

Where ‘N’ is the size of the array and ‘data’ denotes the value of the elements of the array. </p>
